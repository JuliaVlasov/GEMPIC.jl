  abstract = {We present a novel framework for Finite Element Particle-in-Cell methods
based on the discretization of the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the
Vlasov-Maxwell system. We derive a semi-discrete Poisson bracket, which retains
the defining properties of a bracket, anti-symmetry and the Jacobi identity, as
well as conservation of its Casimir invariants, implying that the semi-discrete
system is still a Hamiltonian system. In order to obtain a fully discrete
Poisson integrator, the semi-discrete bracket is used in conjunction with
Hamiltonian splitting methods for integration in time. Techniques from Finite
Element Exterior Calculus ensure conservation of the divergence of the magnetic
field and Gauss' law as well as stability of the field solver. The resulting
methods are gauge invariant, feature exact charge conservation and show
excellent long-time energy and momentum behaviour. Due to the generality of our
framework, these conservation properties are guaranteed independently of a
particular choice of the Finite Element basis, as long as the corresponding
Finite Element spaces satisfy certain compatibility conditions.},
